This is a small, ongoing project to create a movie database website, inspired by IMDb. The application is built with React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

Movie data is retrieved from the external API provided by [The Movie Database](https://developer.themoviedb.org).

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Once it's done you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
